# Tesla-vs.-GameStop-Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Trends-and-Revenue-Data-with-an-Interactive-Dashboard

This project demonstrates how to **extract** and **visualize** stock data using Python. The main steps involved are:

1. **Extracting Stock Data**:
   - I used the `yfinance` library to fetch stock prices for **Tesla** and **GameStop**.

2. **Web Scraping Quarterly Revenue**:
   - I employed **BeautifulSoup** to scrape the quarterly revenue data for Tesla and GameStop from online sources.

3. **Data Cleaning & Processing**:
   - The scraped stock and revenue data was cleaned and processed to ensure it's in the proper format for analysis.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - I used **Plotly** to create interactive graphs that compare **stock performance** against **revenue trends**.

This project provides valuable insights into stock market trends, and the visualizations help in understanding the correlation between stock prices and company performance over time.
